## About
```
The theme of this bot is based around communism.

The goal of The Internationale is to establish a fully autonomous communism zone in shard 2.

The bot is made up of 3 foundational classes: the Red Army, the Proletariat, and the Revolutionaries.

Communes are claimed rooms

The Red Army is in charge of defence and offense.

The Proletariat are in charge of producing and distributing resources

The Revolutionaries are in charge of establishing future communes, and rebuilding destroyed communes.
